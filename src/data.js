    "Detail": "<div class=\"ExternalClass91071F6E89854C78B7D0EE798ECCEB76\"><p>​Building a load for sterilisation requires so much paperwork to be hand written. A load consists of placing product into 96 baskets. Every basket number&#160;is hand written on REA17010 and every basket card has the load number written on it,&#160;as well as scanned into Jbase, when a work order is required to be spilit over numerous baskets then an REA09014&#160;needs&#160;to be&#160;hand written&#160;out for every basket with the following details - Initals and date twice, work order number, basket QTY,&#160;load number, basket number and&#160;basket number for where the work order is placed, these details have also been scaned into jbase.The same detals are also written on the work order.&#160;Load numbers are then written on the MEA and ENDO sample stickers on the product. Work order details for any samples&#160;are then written on REA16051 and REA16052. At compleatation of a load all of this information is pre-printed and checked, before a load print-out can be done, which then gets checked again along with transfering all infromation&#160;of the load basket allocation from REA17010&#160;onto REA17007. Writing all of this infromation over and aover again is not only very time consuming and tring on our hands but with all the different numbers that we have to write, human error does sometimes occur and mistakes do happen. There needs to be a more electronic way of completing this procedure even if it is just printing out&#160;the pre-print page to place into each reqired basket&#160;as soon&#160;the details are entered instead of writing out REA09014 to go into every basket. &#160;</p></div>",

It does not make huge difference in-terms of&#160;inspection of colour/shape/surface quality, etc. </p><p>The only factor which is time consuming in QC checks of these needles is the cannula dimensions (whether we do it manually or on the vision system). For a batch quantity of either 1000 or 2000, the sample size for cannula dimension is no different at all. The sample size is still 50. </p><p>Advantages in doing this;</p><p>1.
